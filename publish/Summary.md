# Quick facts
- Uses 4x 608ZZ bearings.
- Designed for common 1 kg spools of 200 mm diameter, slightly larger up to
  220 mm or smaller down to 180 mm should work well too.
- Short version for 250 g spools of 140mm diameter is also included.
- Practically tested with 1,1 kg spools weighing 1,4 kg in total.
- The mm sizes are the spool width measured from outside to outside.
  STLs provided in 5 mm steps and some common spool widths in between.
- Easy print, can be printed in stages as it's split in several parts.


# I want this, shut up and get me there, NOW!
- PLA is fine, and I only tested with PLA.
- 0.2 mm layer height.
- 3 perimeters (1.2 mm wall width for a 0.4 mm nozzle). 
- 20% infill for all parts, except the hooks and mounts which should be printed
  with 100% infill.

# Assembly

Assembly and usage are easy. After the print assemble the parts like in the
photographs:

- Put the bearings into the rolls.
- Stick the pins through the bearings that are already mounted in the rolls.
- Lay one arm flat.
- Put the pins of the assembled rolls into the pin slot in the arms.
- Put the mount plate into the slots of the arm, with the size label of the
  mount plate facing backwards.
- Push the mount plate up, so that it's hooks slide into the arm.
- Put the second arm on top and slide in the hooks of the mount plate and the
  pins of the rolls. You need to skew the rolls a little, as the mount is not
  yet in the correct position.
- Push the mount plate up again on the second arm, so that it's hooks slide
  into the slots in the arm.
- Put in the connector on the front, with the size label facing backwards.
- Fit the two hooks in the mount plate and hang it on the Skadis pegboard.
  You can also put the hooks on the Skadis pegboard first, and then put the
  CheeseRoller on it.
- You can place a label on the front of the connector, if you want to label
  the spools. It's a tad higher than 14 mm, so a regular 9 mm or 12 mm label
  of a label maker will fit fine.


# The print is started, I got a cup of tea, now tell me the story.

**// Why another spool roller? //**

Filament is a fascinating material. I like to stroll through webshops,
reviews and videos about filament. Every filament delivery that arrives,
makes the day a slightly happier one.

To keep up that happiness, you have to have some ideas to get rid of the
ugly little attachments that the workflow of a filament spool brings into
the game:

- You need to store them in a place, where you can reach them easily.
- You want to see your current stock without scrabbling through cabinets
  and drawers.
- As your filament collection grows, your solution needs to be extensible.
- Spools packed in their cover until their first usage, should be storable.
- Loading filament should be a hassle-free task.
- Unloading filament too.
- You shouldn't care about tangling filament and stuffing the tip of the
  filament somewhere, where it doesn't drive you crazy the next time you
  grab the spool.
- Actually you even shouldn't need to grab the spool and carry it around.
  They should be where you use them, somewhere next to your printer.
- 3D Printing is about beauty and design. When storing the
  filaments visibly, the storage should at least satisfy some degree of
  beauty.


When designing parts to be printed, you also need to take care of the print
process:

- The print should use as less filament as possible.
- It should be easy to print. So it shouldn't need supports, and the print
  should be fast, or it should be possible to do in a couple of stages.


**// The base for the idea //**

A widely used technique to store things are pegboards. A popular option for
DIY crafters is Ikea's Skadis pegboard. It's cheap, easy to mount, comes in
an unobtrusive white, and there are a ton of things to print for it. So I
experimented with a couple of spool holders and rollers for the Skadis pegboard.
All worked great for a single, or a couple of spools. They all solved
some issues mentioned, but none solved them all.


**// Analysis and inspirations //**

I wanted to solve all the mentioned issues. So I began to analyse all the
options I tried, and the options I could find. The primary inspirations came
from **The Filler** (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3020026), for which
I even created a Skadis brace (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4810681),
and the most simple Skadis spool roller I could find
(https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4193268), for which I created a printable
hook (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4810695).


**// The development //**

It took two months of designing, printing prototypes and testing stability, until
the **CheeseRoller** was done. It's name came up when I started to cut holes and
slots into it's main frame like if I wanted to make it look like Swiss Cheese.
That was suitable, as holes in cheese appear, when it matures, just like the
CheeseRoller did mature at this time. The holes and slots are a measure to save
material, speed up print time, and make it sturdy enough for rotating filament
spools, as all the holes and slots add perimeters that make it stiff.


**// What about all the sizes? //**

You could use just one size that fits them all. If all your spools are between 60
and 70 mm wide, measured from outside to outside, you could just print a couple of
70 mm CheeseRollers. The 60 mm spool will fit right away in the 70 mm CheeseRoller
as the spool just stands on the two rolls. The narrower the spool, the more it
tends to tilt a bit when the filament is pulled, especially if the spool is
nearly empty. For this case better use one that fits your spool width. If you
have a 42 mm wide spool, take 45 mm.

To avoid that the spool is clamped between the arms of the frame, every size
adds 2 mm on the left and on the right. The 60 mm size actually is 64 mm wide on
the inside. So the spool can move freely and will not be slowed down by touching
the frame. This additional 2 mm also give you the opportunity to place spools
still packaged in a plastic bag. If you want to place spools not only packaged
in it's bag but also in it's cardboard box, look if you have a free CheeseRoller
of slightly bigger size, as the cardboard box usually takes some more than
4 millimeters.


**// Available sizes //**

I rendered for spool sizes from 40 mm upwards in 5 mm steps, some common spool
widths in between like 68 mm, and also 120 mm and 140 mm for even larger ones.


**// Rendering custom sizes //**

If you need another size, the OpenSCAD Sources are attached. The arms and the hook
are the same for all sizes, you can download the STLs here. For the other parts
download `CheeseRoller Sources.zip`, unzip and load `CheeseRoller Connector.scad`,
`CheeseRoller Mount.scad`, `CheeseRoller Pin.scad` and `CheeseRoller Roll.scad`
in OpenSCAD, enter the `SPOOL_WIDTH` in the OpenSCAD customizer, render the
parts with F6 and save the STL with F7.


**// Tests //**

Note that I only tested with spools of up to 85 mm wide and 1.4 kg of weight.
Double check when using heavy spools that need a 120 mm or even a 140 mm
CheeseRoller, if the weight is carried safely by the CheeseRoller and also
the Skadis board itself. Spools carrying way more than 1kg of filament
usually also have a larger diameter than 220 mm and will be too large for
the design. I also don't use spools of that size. So my intention wasn't designing
and testing for those sizes.


**// Printing duration //**

If you print infrequently, are a beginner or can't let the printer run for some
hours, you probably embrace print projects that can be printed in parts. The parts
that take the longest time are the arms, or above 70 mm size the roll. An arm takes
about 2.5 hours on my Creality CR-10 V2 when printed with 0.2 mm layer
height and a 0.4 nozzle. The roll for 68 mm size takes about the same time as a
single arm. If you can spare another 30 minutes, print two rolls at once, it won't
take twice as long, just about half an hour more for a 68 mm roll. Well, that's
nothing I can be accounted for because of the design, that's just kinda print and
slicer magic.


**// Printing //**

Printing the parts is easy. I only used and tested with PLA. PETG or ABS may work
well too, but test it before printing CheeseRollers for your whole wall.

The parts are all oriented the way they should be printed in the STL. Just load
all the parts into your slicer and print it. The longest parts are the arms.
They are just below 225 mm long. If your print volume is smaller, try to rotate
them by the Z axis. They should fit a 200x200 mm buildplate when rotated so they
are placed diagonally on the build plate.


**// Print settings //**

The relevant recommended print settings:

- 0.2mm layer height
- 3 perimeters (1.2mm wall width for a 0.4mm nozzle)
- 20% infill for all parts, except the hooks and mounts which should be printed with 100% infill.


**// What about the filament path? //**

To guide the filament from the spool it carries, there are vertical holes with
rounded edges in the mount plates. Just guide the filament through them.
If you want to give it some more guidance, you can run a regular PTFE tube with
4 mm outer diameter through the holes. Just be aware of the friction added by
additional PTFE tubes on the filament's path to the printer.

When you unload the filament from the printer, roll the spool back, so the
filament just stays out a bit from the bottom mount hole. The next time you load
it, grab the filament and pull it to your printer. The roll takes care of itself
and unwinds.

An alternative way without any further materials needed is to just pull the
filament down between the mount and the back roll. When the feeder pulls, and
the spool unwinds, the back roll also rotates in the same direction as it should
to give the filament a good go downwards. Depending on the position of your printer,
the filament needs to go sideways and wander on the bottom edge of one of the arms.
The friction there should be low, depending on how far it needs to go sideways.
Just check that path if under extrusion occurs.


**// Placing multiple spools vertically //**

If you wonder why there is more than one path for filament, that's for guiding
filament from multiple CheeseRollers mounted above each other. There are three
hole paths in the mount plates. The middle one is intended to be used for the
filament of the spool the CheeseRoller actually carries. The other two could
be used to guide filament from CheeseRollers mounted above. Additionally, there
are holes for filament in both arms. Look on the arms from the top, you see the
holes about 15 mm inset from the back. On a standard Skadis board there is
enough room to place three CheeseRollers vertically. So the three PTFE paths in
the mounts should be enough if you create filament paths straight down across
the whole Skadis board.


**// Feedback and remixes welcome! //**

If you like the design and print one or two CheeseRollers or fill a whole
Skadis board with CheeseRollers, feel free to give some feedback in the
comments or post a make. Also feel free to remix it. All parts are designed
using OpenSCAD, the source files are attached. If you find optimizations I'd
be glad if you ping me in the comments and give me a hint about what could be
optimized.
